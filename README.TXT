in cats repo
Some changes in the core: Dashboard changed, some internal views were changed.
You will find new module there: jobordersremote. And may be you will manage faster how to put it on repo. Also you may look at our changes.

Also a front-end module built in Drupal to connect remotely. It can be used for Drupal 7 as is and also can be used as an example for other CMS/CMF's and front-ends.
